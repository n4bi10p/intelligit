# **App Name**: IntelliGit

## Core Features:

- Contributor Sidebar: Displays a sidebar panel with a search bar to find contributors, a list of collaborators showing avatars, names, and online status, and a button to add new members.
- Main Panel Tabs: Presents a main panel with tabs for Activity Feed, Tasks, and Code Chat, supporting collaborative development workflows.
- Top Toolbar: Includes a top toolbar inside the main panel with a branch selection dropdown, a synchronization status indicator, and a button to push changes.
- AI-Driven Collaborative Refactoring Suggestions: The AI tool helps developers refactor collaboratively. The tool may take into account several aspects of the collaboration process before including a code refactoring in the discussion. It checks who committed the original code and sends it to that dev first, then checks for code complexity before alerting a senior dev, and so on.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Subtle blue (#64B5F6) to align with VS Code's aesthetic and indicate connectedness without being distracting.
- Background color: Dark gray (#263238), consistent with VS Code's dark theme.
- Accent color: Light blue (#03A9F4) for interactive elements to make them easily identifiable.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, neutral, and readable interface.
- Use flat, minimalistic icons in a light color that matches the accent color to ensure they stand out against the dark background without being intrusive.
- Employ good spacing and padding to ensure elements are easily readable and clickable, adhering to a clean and organized design.
- Use subtle animations for state transitions (e.g., hover effects, loading spinners) to provide feedback without being distracting.
